"""CI guard: forbid hardcoded magic constants in the fill simulator.

Every parameter that affects fill probability must be either:
  * a venue-defined constant (fees, tick size — hardcoded is fine);
  * a unit conversion;
  * read from ``services.fill_simulator.empirical_constants`` (learned
    from book_delta_events) or ``services.fill_simulator.latency``
    (measured from execution_latency_metrics) or operator override
    (set via the UI).

This script scans the two simulator-critical modules for raw float
literals that look like fill-model magic numbers (0.x, where x is
not 0 or 1) and fails the build if any new ones are introduced
without an explicit allowlist comment.

Usage:
    python scripts/ci/check_no_hardcoded_fill_constants.py
Exit code 0 = pass; non-zero = forbidden literal found.
