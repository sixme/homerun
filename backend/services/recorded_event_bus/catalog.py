"""Topic catalog — registry of every recorded-event topic in the system.

The catalog is read on every ``bus.publish`` (cached in memory with a
short TTL) and on every ``bus.replay`` (uncached — replay is a slow
path).  Reads are >> writes by ~5 orders of magnitude in production,
so the in-memory cache is the right shape: refresh every few seconds,
invalidate on writes from this process.

This module owns:
  * :class:`TopicSpec` — the dataclass projection of the
    ``topic_catalog`` ORM row, used by all bus consumers.  Plain
    Python (no SQLAlchemy session leakage) so it round-trips through
    queues and cross-process pickles cleanly.
  * The async API: :func:`register_topic`, :func:`get_topic`,
    :func:`list_topics`, :func:`delete_topic`.
  * Seed data — the well-known topics that wrap pre-existing SQL
    tables get registered on first import so the bus is usable
    without a manual setup step.

# bus.publish reads the topic spec on every call.  With a hot path of
# ~10k events/sec we cannot afford a Postgres round-trip per call.  A
# small in-memory cache with a short TTL is the right shape:
#
#   * TTL = 5s → spec changes from the UI propagate fast enough
#     for human ergonomics (operator updates retention; it takes
#     effect within seconds).
#   * Invalidation on local writes → register_topic/delete_topic
#     bust the cache so the calling process never sees its own
#     stale read.
#
# Cross-process invalidation isn't needed for the registry data —
# topics rarely change shape — but the publish/replay timestamps
# would benefit from it.  Out of scope for v1; revisit when the
# operator UI starts showing live "events/sec by topic" charts.
