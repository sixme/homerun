"""The unified recorded-event bus.

Three responsibilities, in order of hot-path frequency:

  1. **Live publish** (10k+ events/sec at peak).  Recorders call
     ``await bus.publish(event)``; the bus validates against the
     topic catalog (cached), fans out to in-process subscribers,
     and queues the event for storage if the topic is persistent.
     Hot path is mostly cache hits + memory allocation; the slow
     stuff (persistence, cross-process delivery) happens out-of-band.

  2. **Live subscribe** (a handful per process at startup).
     Strategies / runtime services call ``bus.subscribe(topic, handler)``
     once at boot.  Handlers run as tasks so a slow handler doesn't
     back up the publish hot path.  Same delivery-once semantics
     the existing ``services.event_dispatcher`` provides — easy
     migration path.

  3. **Backtest replay** (slow, batched).  The runner calls
     ``bus.replay(window, topics)`` to get an async iterator of
     ``RecordedEvent`` time-merged across topics.  Each topic
     resolves to its storage backend (parquet / sql_table / memory)
     via the catalog; the bus heap-merges the per-topic streams so
     subscribers see one ordered sequence.

The bus is intentionally a thin coordination layer.  All the
heavy lifting (parquet writes/reads, SQL adapters) lives in the
``storage`` module so the bus stays small enough to reason about.

The bus is process-local.  Cross-process pub/sub goes through the
existing :mod:`services.event_bus` (the WebSocket fanout) for live
fan-out, and through the storage backend for persistent topics —
process B replays from disk what process A wrote.  No Redis, no
Kafka; this is an institutional-grade trading system, not an event-
sourcing platform, and adding a new infra dep would dwarf the cost
of any latency we'd save.
